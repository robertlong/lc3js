The LC3 Simulator and Editor in the cloud!

Learning languages and tools should be easy to setup, code, and debug on. The goal is to remove the barriers needed to
work on this great system so that anyone can get started and spend more time learning.

Also, I want to teach myself how to write a computer emulator and assembler, so let's do this!

Note:
I'm just learning the LC3 architecture, assembly, and basically everything for the first time.
Excuse any terrible code as I don't exactly know what I'm doing yet.
